      This specification defines a [[[MEDIA-SOURCE]]] [[MEDIA-SOURCE]] byte stream format specification based on MPEG-2 Transport Streams [[MPEG2TS]].
    </section>

    <section id="sotd">
      <p>The working group maintains <a href="https://github.com/w3c/mse-byte-stream-format-mp2t/issues">a list of all bug reports that the editors have not yet tried to address</a>;
      there may also be related open bugs in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/media-source">GitHub repository</a> of the [[[MEDIA-SOURCE]]] specification.</p>

    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This specification defines segment formats for implementations of [[[MEDIA-SOURCE]]] [[MEDIA-SOURCE]] that choose to support MPEG-2 Transport Streams [[MPEG2TS]].</p>
      <p>It defines the MIME-type parameters used to signal codecs, and provides
      the necessary format specific definitions for [=initialization segments=], [=media segments=], and [=random access points=] required by
      the <a data-cite="media-source#byte-stream-formats">Byte Stream Formats section</a> of the [[[MEDIA-SOURCE]]] specification. This document also defines extra behaviors and state that only apply to this byte stream format.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mime-parameters">
      <h2>MIME-type info</h2>
      <p>The MIME-type/subtype pair of "video/MP2T", as specified in [[RFC3551]], MUST be used for byte streams that conform
        to this specification.</p>

      <p>The following parameter can be used in the MIME-type passed to {{MediaSource/isTypeSupported()}} or {{MediaSource/addSourceBuffer()}}.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>codecs</dt>
        <dd>
          A comma separated list of codec IDs used to specify what codecs will be used in the byte stream. Implementations SHOULD accept IDs in the form specified by [[RFC6381]].
          <div class="note">Implementations MAY only implement a subset of the codecs and profiles mentioned in the RFC.</div>
        </dd>
      </dl>

    <section id="mpeg2ts-general">
      <h4>General Transport Stream Requirements</h4>
      <p>MPEG-2 TS [=media segments=] and [=initialization segments=] MUST conform to the MPEG-2 TS Adaptive Profile [[MPEG2TS]].</p>

      <p>The user agent MUST run the [=append error=] algorithm if any of the following conditions are met:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Segments do not contain complete MPEG-2 TS packets.</li>
        <li>Segments do not contain complete PES packets and sections.</li>
        <li>Segments contain more than one program.</li>
        <li>At least one MPEG-2 TS packet has a non-zero transport_error_indicator.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section id="mpeg2ts-init-segments">
      <h4>Initialization Segments</h4>
      <p>An MPEG-2 TS [=initialization segment=] consists of a single PAT and a single PMT.</p>
      <p>The user agent MUST run the [=append error=] algorithm if any of the following conditions are met:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A PAT is not present in the [=initialization segment=]</li>
        <li>A PMT is not present in the [=initialization segment=]</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The user agent MUST accept and ignore other SI, such as CAT, that are invariant for all subsequent [=media segments=].</p>
      <p>The user agent MUST source attribute values for `id`, `kind`, `label` and `language` for {{AudioTrack}}, {{VideoTrack}} and
        {{TextTrack}} objects as described for MPEG-2 Transport Streams in the in-band tracks spec [[INBANDTRACKS]].</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mpeg2ts-media-segments">
      <h4>Media Segments</h4>

      <p>The user agent MUST run the [=append error=] algorithm if any of the following conditions are met:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A [=media segment=] relies on initialization information in another [=media segment=].</li>
        <li>At least one PES packet does not have a PTS timestamp.</li>
        <li>PCR is not present in the Segment prior to the first byte of a TS packet payload containing media data.</li>
      </ol>

      The user agent will accept and ignore PSI that is identical to the information in the last [=initialization segment=] which may appear repeatedly throughout the segment.
    </section>

    <section id="mpeg2ts-random-access-points">
      <h4>Random Access Points</h4>
      <p>A [=random access point=] as defined in this specification corresponds to Elementary Stream Random Access Point as defined in
        [[MPEG2TS]].</p>
    </section>
    <section id="mpeg2ts-discontinuities">
      <h4>Timestamp Rollover &amp; Discontinuities</h4>
      <p>Timestamp rollovers and discontinuities MUST be handled by the UA. The UA's MPEG-2 TS implementation MUST maintain an internal offset
        variable, <dfn>MPEG2TS_timestampOffset</dfn>, to keep track of the offset that needs to be applied to timestamps
        that have rolled over or are part of a discontinuity. <a>MPEG2TS_timestampOffset</a> is initially set to 0 when the <a class="externalDFN">SourceBuffer</a> is
        created.  This offset MUST be applied to the timestamps as part of the conversion process from MPEG-2 TS packets
        into [=coded frames=] for the [=coded frame processing=] algorithm. This results in the coded frame timestamps
        for a packet being computed by the following equations:</p>
      <pre>
        Coded Frame Presentation Timestamp = (MPEG-2 TS presentation timestamp) + <var>MPEG2TS_timestampOffset</var>
        Coded Frame Decode Timestamp = (MPEG-2 TS decode timestamp) + <var>MPEG2TS_timestampOffset</var></pre>

      <p><a>MPEG2TS_timestampOffset</a> is updated in the following ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each time a timestamp rollover is detected, 2^33 MUST be added to <a>MPEG2TS_timestampOffset</a>.</li>
        <li>When a discontinuity is detected, <a>MPEG2TS_timestampOffset</a> MUST be adjusted to make the timestamps after the discontinuity appear
          to come immediately after the timestamps before the discontinuity.</li>
        <li>When {{SourceBuffer/abort()}} is called, <a>MPEG2TS_timestampOffset</a> MUST be set to 0.</li>
        <li>When {{SourceBuffer/timestampOffset}} is successfully set, <a>MPEG2TS_timestampOffset</a> MUST be set to 0.</li>
      </ul>
